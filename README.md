# Chainboard

Chainboard is a production-grade Web3 dashboard designed to demonstrate modern full-stack architecture using Next.js (React 18), TypeScript, and Web3 technologies.

## Overview

Chainboard aims to build a realistic Web3 DApp with clear boundaries between:
- Public, server-rendered pages (SSR)
- Client-side wallet interactions
- Smart contracts and on-chain data

This project is structured as a monorepo to reflect how modern Web3 teams organize frontend applications, smart contracts, and shared packages.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js (App Router, React 18)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Web3 (Ethers / Wagmi)
- Solidity & Hardhat (planned)
- GitHub Actions (CI)
- Cloud deployment (planned)

## Project Status

🚧 **In active development**

More features, architecture details, and setup instructions will be added as the project evolves.
